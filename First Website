<h1>What I am Trying to Say</h1>
<p>I think this so confusing and I do not understand. I still have a hard understand where I need to write in order for it to transfer correctly. I think I may try and make a recipe to work on headings and lists and see if that helps me.</p>

<h2> How to make buttercream</h2>
<p> Ingredients list>p<
  * 2 Sticks room temp butter
  * 2lbs powdered sugar
  * 1 tsp vanilla 
  * 1/2 tps kosher salt
  * Whole milk

1. Put room temperature butter in either a large bowl or in the bowl of a stand mixer. Begin to beat on a medium speed until butter lightens in color and is light and fluffy, occasionally scraping down sides, approximately 5 minutes.
2. Begin to add powdered sugar into butter in small incriments as not to lose all the powdered sugar when you turn the mixer on. 
3. Beat well between each addition. 
4. Once all the powdered sugar has been incorporated, add salt and vanilla. Beat well.
With the mixer on medium speed, begin to add milk one tablespoon at a time. Beat for several minutes between each addition as you don't want to make the buttercream too lose. Once you have reached your desired texture, let mixer run for about 10 minutes to beat air into the mixture and incorporate the sugar as to lose its graininess.
